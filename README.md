# Face and Edge Detection with OpenCV 🖼️✨

## Overview 📋
This project leverages **OpenCV**, a powerful computer vision library, to implement a face detection and edge detection system. The program can detect faces, eyes, and smiles in images or real-time video streams, while also identifying edges in images for enhanced visual understanding.

## Features 🚀
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces, eyes, and smiles using pre-trained Haar cascades.
- **Edge Detection**: Applies Canny Edge Detection to extract edges from images, highlighting structural details.
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Processes live video streams for face and feature recognition.
- **Versatile Input**: Supports multiple input sources, including images and video.

## Project Structure 📂
1. **Face Detection**:
   - Utilizes Haar cascade classifiers for face, eye, and smile detection.
   - Draws bounding boxes around detected features in images or video.
2. **Edge Detection**:
   - Applies the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to grayscale images.
   - Visualizes edges for better structural representation.
3. **Bonus Challenge**:
   - Adds real-time detection for faces and facial features, including eyes and noses.

## Usage 🛠️
1. **Input Images**:
   - Place your images in the `resources` folder.
   - Modify the file paths in the code to match your image names.
2. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute the notebook to detect faces or edges in the provided images.
   - For real-time processing, run the bonus challenge script and access your webcam.

## Example Outputs 🌟
- **Face Detection**: Bounding boxes highlighting detected faces, eyes, and smiles.
- **Edge Detection**: Edge-enhanced visualizations of input images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Dynamic face and feature tracking in a live video feed.

## Applications 💡
- **Security and Surveillance**: Detect faces and features in real-time.
- **Image Analysis**: Enhance image structures using edge detection.
- **AI and CV Learning**: Understand the fundamentals of computer vision with hands-on examples.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **Haar Cascade Classifiers**: Pre-trained models for feature detection.
